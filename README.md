Module 21 Individual Self Assessment Deliverable

# Self Assessment

  Over the course of the final project, I had the role of doing the exploratory analysis of our NFL combine dataset.  Throughout this exploratory I cleaned up the data to extract the necessary data to help conduct our overall objective of prediciting if a player would be drafted or not.  Though our dataset contained results that were already confirmed, through the drafted column being yes or no, that did not affect how I approached the exploratory analysis.  That column was left as a reference point when creating dataframes that contained players, their event stats, and physical traits.  It was also beneficial to keep the drafted column to create two separate dataframes, one for those players drafted and one for those not drafted.  
  
  The greatest challenge with the assignment wasn't necessarily related to the assignment itself, but in regards to managing my time properly to contribute my portion and help to my teammates.  This is because I am involved in a social group where I hold a leadership position.  Through communication with my teammates and personal time management, I was able to devote the necessary time to help meet the objectives of our analysis and deadlines.
  
  Having open dialouge with my teammates about all aspects of the analysis is how we all contributed to roles we did not participate in.  By this I mean we would talk all decision through as a cohesive unit to come to an overall concensious before moving forward with the final decision.  This allowed for us to deliver our best work throughout each segement of the project.

# Project and Team Summary

  Communication was something that was surprisingly easy with our group.  We relied heavliy on our Slack group channel to communicate throughout the duration of the project.  Not only that we did schedule our own Zoom meetings outside of class time to work together to not only discuss our current objectives and future goals, but also to practice our presentation.  I would say our team's greatest strength was communicaiton, we always had an open dialogue on what has happened, what is happening, and what is going to happen.  This really formed the foundation of how we completed the project from the initial topic decision, role assigning, and final presentation.
  
  The topic we addressed was to predict a 75% success rate on whether someone would be drafted based on NFL combine statistics from 2009 - 2019.  To address our main question, a neural network model was used to determine if a player would be drafted into the NFL based on their combine statistics.  Results were not what we hoped but they came close.  Our neural network predicted with 73.9% accuracy that a player would be drafted to the NFL based on their NFL combine statistics.
